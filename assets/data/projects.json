      "description": "HeartSync is an innovative project designed to externalize emotions using a heartbeat monitoring device. Inspired by an old clock, this device integrates a MAX30102 sensor for accurate heart rate monitoring, an ESP32 microcontroller for data processing, and a servo motor to display heart rate information on the clock face. By visualizing the heartbeat, HeartSync enhances self-understanding and interpersonal connections. This project merges creative design with physical computing to create a unique emotional interface.",
