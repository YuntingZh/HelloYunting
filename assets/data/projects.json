      "description": "HeartSync is an innovative project designed to externalize emotions using a heartbeat monitoring device. Inspired by an old clock, this device integrates a MAX30102 sensor for accurate heart rate monitoring, an ESP32 microcontroller for data processing, and a servo motor to display heart rate information on the clock face. By visualizing the heartbeat, HeartSync enhances self-understanding and interpersonal connections. This project merges creative design with physical computing to create a unique emotional interface.",

        "description": "This project focused on developing an all-in-one AR interface for NASA astronauts. Our innovative design, created in collaboration with UC Berkeley and Baylor University, ensures critical information is non-intrusive and always visible. Using voice commands powered by a language model (LLM), astronauts can operate hands-free. Additionally, the interface includes a rover tracking feature to control Leo rovers. By integrating robot digital twin datasets, our team significantly contributed to space exploration technology. Fun fact: We often shouted 'Hello Bear!' during tests.",
