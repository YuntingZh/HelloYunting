                    <!-- <p class="project-basic-text">Painting has always been an integral part of my life, a medium through
                        which I express my deepest passion for visual communication. From a young age, drawing helped me
                        connect with and understand the world around me. I remember sketching churches, noting how
                        Catholic crucifixes include Jesus while Protestant crosses stand bare. I also recall studying
                        the light at dusk, noticing how only the tallest points of the highest buildings catch the
                        fading sun. These experiences sharpened my sensitivity to visual details and storytelling
                        through art.<br>

                        In 2022, when diffusion model AIs transformed the art and design world, I witnessed firsthand
                        how they revolutionized workflows for animators, painters, and designers. The ongoing discussion
                        around AI's influence on the future of creativity led me to question its potential impact on
                        traditional painting. With my background in computer science and interactive media, I naturally
                        became interested in how AI could enhance human-computer interaction (HCI) within art tools.
                        <br>
                        After exploring the field of human-robot co-creation, I became fascinated by how early models
                        like SketchRNN and pix2pix offer exciting opportunities to blend AI with traditional art forms,
                        particularly in doodle art for early education. In my current master's thesis, I’m investigating
                        how AI can serve as a facilitative tool to enhance and support conventional painting techniques.

                        I would love to hear your thoughts if this intersection of AI and traditional art resonates with
                        you:)

                        the gap between traditional art and modern technology, fostering creativity, confidence, and
                        skill development in K-12 education. <br>By integrating tactile interactions, real-time AI
                        feedback, and user-centered design, it transforms traditional artistic practices into accessible
                        and engaging learning experiences.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        While digital art tools are abundant, they often lack the tactile,
                        hands-on experiences crucial for the skill development of young learners. Traditional art
                        mediums, despite their rich educational potential, are intimidating to beginners and children
                        due to technical demands, discouraging participation.<br>

                        Drawing Buddy addresses these challenges by introducing AI-guided real-time feedback and hybrid
                        digital-tactile interactions, making traditional art more appealing and approachable.

                    <p class="project-basic-text">Earlier this year, while teaching an art class at John O'Connell High
                        School, I observed a stark contrast in students' attitudes toward artistic creation. Some
                        students completed tasks half-heartedly just to earn credits, while others were fully immersed.
                        Many, however, lacked confidence and gave up altogether.
                        <br><br>

                        Conversations with art teachers revealed that traditional media remain the primary teaching
                        tools, yet many students struggle when faced with a blank canvas. One student attempted to draw
                        the video game character Yoshi but found it difficult to maintain proportions and structure,
                        visibly frustrated. Another tried to depict fireworks in the night sky but felt unable to
                        translate her vision onto paper, displaying clear disappointment by the end of the session.
                        These experiences resonated with my own childhood struggles in art due to a lack of guidance and
                        confidence.
                        <br><br>

                        This phenomenon aligns with Davis’s “U-shaped theory,” which highlights a decline in children’s
                        interest and confidence in drawing as they grow older, driven by educational pressures and the
                        prioritization of standardized assessments.
                        <br><br>


                        On that day, I taught six periods, interacting with around 180 students and speaking with
                        several art teachers. A common theme emerged: many students did not know how to start drawing or
                        felt stuck after taking the initial steps. They expressed that while they could follow
                        step-by-step guidance in class, they struggled to create independently, unable to translate
                        mental images into sketches on paper.

                    <div class="small-spacer"></div>
                    <p class="project-basic-text">

                        To help students overcome these challenges, we designed the first prototype of the Drawing Buddy
                        (see picture below). This compact drawing box featured a lightbox at its base to record user
                        input.
                        When needed, the system would generate suggestions for the next steps in the creative process
                        and project them onto the paper under the lightbox. This feature aimed to provide actionable
                        visual guidance, helping users overcome hesitation or a lack of inspiration.<br><br>


                        We also brought this drawing assistant to Maker Faire to collect additional user feedback.</p>

                        Later iterations highlighted the need for a more flexible medium, such as larger canvases and
                        support for younger users. This led to the development of a second version of Drawing Buddy,
                        which functioned more like a toy. It included a control dial with generation buttons and a
                        microphone, allowing users to receive drawing suggestions projected directly onto their canvas
                        or medium of choice.

                        Developing Drawing Buddy taught me that creativity thrives when supported by a system that values both structure and freedom. It’s not just about removing barriers like fear of failure, but about creating moments of discovery—where a child realizes, “I can figure this out.” I learned that true engagement comes when tools feel like collaborators rather than instructors, and when they invite curiosity instead of dictating outcomes. <br><br>Moving forward, I’m interested in exploring how design can create more of these “aha” moments, not by giving all the answers, but by leaving space for users to surprise themselves.</pr>

                        I explored different art style pipelines for 3D artists to generate stable, realistic results
                        for scene design. This pipeline, created with ComfyUI and Stable Diffusion, is designed as an
                        extensibility solution that redefines the process of creating realistic environment concept art.
                        I tested and integrated it with TouchDesigner to generate real-time images, and it can be
                        further integrated into Unity for quickly generating art backgrounds for 2D games.
