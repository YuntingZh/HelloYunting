                        In 2022, I joined ShiftPixy Labs, where the team was developing a digital food brand. One of the
                        main projects I worked on was Cluckin Lucky, a game featuring a chicken wearing a yellow
                        raincoat, designed as the brand’s mascot. As the game developer and user experience designer, I
                        collaborated with the team to build the Cluckin Lucky endless runner game.

                        The game is embedded within the food ordering app, designed to entertain users while they wait
                        for their order to be delivered. Players can collect points during the game, which can be
                        redeemed for discounts on future orders. Our goal was to create a fun and immersive experience
                        that would enhance customer engagement with the restaurant brand, connecting entertainment with
                        dining. The challenge was integrating the brand’s identity into a game that was not only
                        entertaining but also provided practical rewards in the form of food discounts, encouraging
                        repeat visits.

                        One of my key contributions was refining the system for generating obstacles in the endless
                        runner. Initially, the game used a random placement for obstacles, but during internal testing,
                        I found that this led to either overly sparse or clustered placements. This affected gameplay
                        pacing and balance, making it unpredictable and frustrating for players.

                        The visual design was crafted to reflect the playful and approachable nature of the brand. I
                        collaborated closely with the art team to ensure that the chicken character and the overall
                        environment aligned with the brand’s identity. Using Blender and Maya, we developed a vibrant,
                        cartoon-like world featuring playful elements such as oversized food items and rain-themed
                        visuals that matched the character's yellow raincoat. The colorful design was intended to
                        quickly capture the user's attention, reinforcing the brand’s fun and family-friendly image.

                    <p class="project-basic-text">
                        In the game, I was responsible for designing the visual effects when the main character consumed
                        special bonus items and gained invincibility. I created a fiery effect around the character
                        using shader graphics and the particle system, which generated a trailing aura to represent the
                        character’s newfound power. By carefully adjusting the particle flow and shader parameters, I
                        was able to strike a balance, making the power-up both visually exciting and consistent with the
                        playful, vibrant style of the game.
