                        This summer, I work as the lead UI/UX designer for this NSF-funded SunWATER+ project. Since my undergraduate days working on urban energy planning data visualization at the GIS center, I’ve been particularly fascinated by sustainable energy, especially solar power. The SunWATER+ initiative aims to develop a scalable solar-powered greywater reuse system, integrating advanced nanotechnology and AI to address critical challenges in water management and energy efficiency.

                            SunWATER+ uses visual and audio feedback to confirm when actions are taken or when the system needs attention. For example, if a water filtration issue arises, the system highlights the relevant part of the dashboard, while also sending notifications. This ensures that building managers and households can quickly resolve issues without needing to continuously monitor the system.
