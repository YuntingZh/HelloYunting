                            Throughout the project, I collaborated closely with a diverse team of renowned professors,
                            scientists, and engineers, contributing to the system's design, which will be implemented

                            experience in designing user-centric interfaces for complex systems. Collaborating with
                            interdisciplinary teams of engineers and researchers taught me how to balance technical
                            requirements with intuitive design.

                            Additionally, I deepened my understanding of sustainable energy solutions, particularly
                            solar-powered greywater reuse, and learned how to integrate technologies like AI and
                            nanotechnology into scalable systems. This project enhanced my ability to approach design
